# DevSwipe

**Tagline:**  
Swipe right on projects, collaborators, and opportunities. Left on bugs. 🐞

---

## Project Overview

**DevSwipe** is a Tinder-inspired platform built with the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — tailored specifically for full-stack developers. It lets you discover new projects, collaborators, and opportunities through a familiar swiping interface. Swipe right if you're interested, left if it's a no-go.

This project demonstrates how to build a modern full-stack Tinder-like app, covering everything from architecture design to implementing features such as user authentication, swipeable cards, matchmaking, and real-time chat using WebSockets.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT and password hashing  
- Swipe cards UI to browse projects and collaborators  
- Matchmaking when two users swipe right on each other  
- Real-time chat for matched users powered by Socket.io  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Developer-centric profiles showcasing skills and projects

## MERN Stack Tech Overview

| Layer       | Technology           | Purpose                               |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend    | React.js             | UI components, swipe gestures        |
| Backend API | Node.js + Express.js | RESTful API, authentication          |
| Database    | MongoDB + Mongoose   | Data storage for users, matches, chats |
| Real-time   | Socket.io            | WebSocket-based real-time chat       |

## Architecture

- React frontend communicates with Express API backend  
- MongoDB stores user profiles, swipes, matches, chat history  
- Socket.io integrated with Express backend for real-time messaging

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)  
- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)  
- Git  

### Steps

```bash

#git clone project repo link
git clone https://github.com/harshikab2112/Main-Flow-Services-And-Technologies-Internship-Tasks.git
#Navigate to the project folder:
cd Main-Flow-Services-And-Technologies-Internship-Tasks/Task 9

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
# Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with:
# MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# PORT=5000
npm run dev

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How It Works

* Users register/login with email and password
* Profiles display skills and projects
* Swipe cards let users like or pass on others
* Matches trigger when two users like each other
* Matched users chat in real-time using Socket.io
